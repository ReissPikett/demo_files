# Summary of demo files

# Cherenkov Radiation Study
Simulation and analysis of scintillator and Cherenkov radiation photons generated
by atmospheric muons. Demonstration of general python ability, as well as specific skills such as monte carlo 
simulation (section - exit time of scintillation photons), algorithm development (section - full path of internal 
photon reflection inside scintillator, data visulalisation of the various data involved. note - almost but not totally finished

# NLP Voice Classification
Prototype software to transcribe speech audio, develop machine learning algorithm for classifying text, and
creating an effective means of applying algorithm to text to ensure accurate results. Demonstrates Natural
Language Programming and Machnine Learning experience, a well as general python and data analysis skills to determine
various accuracy metrics in order to develop the most effective solutions. As the project is somewhat confidential, I have only
included the presentations describingthe functionality rather than the code itself. Required used of NLP python packages
such as NLTK and spaCy, as well as using AWS console and machine learning algorithms.

# Sample Data Structures and Algorithms
Ongoing C# script for developing complex data structures and algorithms. Currently shows development and implementation
of Binary Trees, Linked Lists, and Stacks. To be added: complex sorting algorithms. 

# Stats and Modelling
jupyter scripts showing the mathemtical/statistical theory, as well as application of statistical metrics, tools and methods,
as well as modelling techniques including linear, polynomial, multivariate and Logistic Regression to stock price data.
I have also completed many Machine Learning and Data analysis courses in which the practice with and completion of jupyter
scripts with such methods are included, such as logistic regression used in classification, descision trees and minimising
entropy in decisions in order to classify data, K-Nearest Neightbours in classification, as well as clustering methods such as
Support Vector Machines, Agglomerative Hierarchical structuring and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
(DBSCAN), as well as other data techniques like as Principle Component Analysis. Even though the participant is required to perform
these techniques themselves, the notebooks and the data sets are property of the creators of the courses and so I would rather not
share them as though they are mine. The links to some of these courses are below:
